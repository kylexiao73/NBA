This is a web site coded using React to show every NBA players' information.
Created a field goal percentage filter to provide detailed visualization areas with made shots according to playersâ€™ number of shot attempts.
It also contains a scatter plot to more specifically visualize stats for every attempt and made shots season-wised.
Data obtained from  http://stats.nba.com
